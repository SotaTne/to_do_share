A new Flutter project.

This app is my first app for android and can be used mainly as a "todolist". The language is developed using "flutter" of "dart".
I'm a newbie so some code might be hard to read, but please bear with me.
Since this app is for Japanese users, it has not yet been set up to support multiple languages, but we plan to develop it in the future.
It is still in the production stage, so it has not been released, but I plan to release it in the future.
